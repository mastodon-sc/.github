# About Mastodon.

> :warning: This organization refers to Mastodon: the open-source scientific software for tracking cells and line aging in large microscopy generated in Life-Sciences. It does not refer to Mastodon: the decentralized social network. For the latter, please refer to [https://github.com/mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon)


Mastodon is a large-scale tracking and track-editing framework for large, multi-view images, such as the ones that are typically generated in the domain Development Biology or Stem-Cell Biology or Cell Biology.

Why using Mastodon?

Modern microscopy technologies such as light sheet microscopy allows live sample *in toto* 3D imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. 
Such images will be 3D over time, possibly multi-channels and multi-view. 
Computational analysis of these images promises new insights in cellular, developmental and stem cells biology. 
However, a single image can amount to several terabytes, and in turn, the automated or semi-automated analysis of these large images can generate a vast amount of annotations. 
The challenges of big data are then met twice: first by dealing with a very large image, and second with generating large annotations from this image. 
They will make interacting and analyzing the data especially difficult.

**Mastodon** is our effort to provide a tool that can harness these challenges.
