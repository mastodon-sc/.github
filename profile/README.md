# About Mastodon.

> :warning: This organization refers to Mastodon: the open-source scientific software for tracking cells and line aging in large microscopy generated in Life-Sciences. It does not refer to Mastodon: the decentralized social network. For the latter, please refer to [https://github.com/mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon)


Mastodon is a large-scale tracking and track-editing framework for large, multi-view images, such as the ones that are typically generated in the domain Development Biology or Stem-Cell Biology or Cell Biology.

Why using Mastodon?

Modern microscopy technologies such as light sheet microscopy allows live sample *in toto* 3D imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. 
Such images will be 3D over time, possibly multi-channels and multi-view. 
Computational analysis of these images promises new insights in cellular, developmental and stem cells biology. 
However, a single image can amount to several terabytes, and in turn, the automated or semi-automated analysis of these large images can generate a vast amount of annotations. 
The challenges of big data are then met twice: first by dealing with a very large image, and second with generating large annotations from this image. 
They will make interacting and analyzing the data especially difficult.

**Mastodon** is our effort to provide a tool that can harness these challenges. 
You can find the user and developer documentation [here](https://mastodon.readthedocs.io/).

This page describes the repositories of this organization and list maintainers and responsibilities.

### Repositories and responsibilities. 

Mastodon tries to offer at the same time 
- A Java library for manipulating collections and mathematical graphs containing a very large number of objects.
- A scientific application ('Mastodon') that uses this library to offer Researchers of Life-Sciences a user-friendly tool to perform cell tracking and lineaging in large movies.
- Several optional modules and contributions that extend the features of the Mastodon application.

This results in having about 10 repositories in this organization, that we list and describe briefly in the  below.
